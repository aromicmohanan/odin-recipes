    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These 5-ingredient croque monsieur sliders are a fantastic appetizer. Think ham and cheese sliders that are
        neither too sweet or savory. The soft fluffy Hawaiian rolls knock this recipe out of the park.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>4 Hawaiian rolls</li>
        <li>2 large slices deli ham, cut in half</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
        <li>Open up rolls but keep them attached. Lay them flat on the baking sheet. Stir mustard and butter together;
            spread over inner sides of rolls, on both top and bottom. </li>
        <li>Add a half piece of ham to bottom half of each roll; fold as needed to fit. Sprinkle each roll with a small
            amount of cheese. Close rolls over filling. Melt remaining butter and mustard mixture; brush over tops of
            rolls. Sprinkle each roll evenly with remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is completely melted, about 10 minutes. Serve warm with more mustard
            for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
